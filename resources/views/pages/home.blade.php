    <h3>
            Learning Japanese can be difficult, but here we learn using the easiest method available. No matter what kind of japanese you learn, we've put together this guide for that purpose! Just follow the steps and you'll be able to see how it all works by the end.

            The reason we have this guide is that you never know what you might see, especially if your eyes have never been to a Japanese school. Even if you didn't speak any sort of japanese for the entire time, if you look carefully you know this is your first time reading Japanese! It has nothing to do with the amount of mistakes you're likely to make at the first day, but as you get used to reading Japanese and begin learning the language better, you might be able to put it past the first night.4
